Simple D3 dashboard showing COVID-19 cases for Münster, Germany, in comparison to neighbouring administrative areas. Data from [Open Data Münster](https://opendata.stadt-muenster.de/dataset/coronavirus-infektionen-sars-cov-2-im-regierungsbezirk-m%C3%BCnster), therefore automatically updated whenever the data is updated.

Some days (e.g. Easter) did not contain information about recovered or deceased patients. For the visualization, it is assumed that the numbers have not changed from the previous day.
